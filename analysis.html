                                    <p>Data visualisation is an essential, yet sometimes overlooked, step of data analysis.  In our case Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques will prove useful both for visualisation and clustering purposes, as scRNAseq data contains a huge number of dimensions.
										DR will reduce the dimensions of the data to facilitate its manipulation and feeding into downstream clustering algorithms. </p>
                                    <p>In this section the different DR approaches taken are shown, with a brief description of each method used, its strength and weaknesses, and plots for the final DR spaces they produce. </p>

												<p>Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, was the first approach taken. It is a transformation-based approach that calculates new dimensions or components to try and capture the maximum amount of variance possible in the original high-dimensional space.</p>
												<p>Making use of the technical variances calculated in the <a href="pre-process.html">previous section</a> we can remove that random noise by performing PCA and <em>scran</em>’s denoisePCA function. </p>
												<p>A plot of our cells in the PCA space is shown on <a href="#pca_plot">Figure 8</a>. It is immediately noticeable that no apparent division of cells appears, with all cells clustered together as one mass, 
													and that PCA does not render very informative results for the first two components explain only 3% and 1% of the total variance. The reasons this might be happening will be discussed in the <a href="discussion.html">following section</a>,
													but PCA has already been described as being a less than ideal DR approach for sparse scRNAseq data.</p>

												<p>t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding, also known as t-SNE, is a newer DR approach described in <a href="#">Maaten and Hinton, 2008</a>. It maps high dimensional data to 2 dimensions by performing random walks on neighbourhood graphs and can deal better results in more diverse and higher dimensional cell populations.</p>
												<p>To make use of the denoising performed above we calculate its reduced dimensions from the PCA data. A stochastic process by definition, the resulting graphs all showed different topologies even if the perplexity value was kept constant.</p>
												<p>On <a href="#tsne_plot">Figure 9</a> one such plot is given with a perplexity value of 15 and no random seed predefined. I settled at perplexity=15 since that seemed to produce the most consistent topologies while still avoiding the tendency to crowd points together at the centre of the map.</p>

												<p>Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is DR technique that can be used in similar situations as t-SNE. Published last year on <a href="#">McInnes et al., 2018</a> it works based on manifold modelling via fuzzy topologies and subsequent embedding on a lower-dimension projection.
													Its main advantages over t-SNE are that it is less computationally intense while better preserving global structure of the data at comparable details of local neighbour relations.</p>
												<p>UMAP plots obtained from our data presented more consistent overall topologies than their t-SNE counterparts, while adjusting to the clusters found better than PCA.  A UMAP plot can be seen on <a href="#umap_plot">Figure 10</a>.</p>

                                    <h2 id="clust">5.2- Unsupervised clustering</h2>
									<p>Unsupervised clustering are machine learning approaches that aim to infer new information from unlabelled data by grouping the data and finding hidden patterns. In our case, as introduced in <a href="aim.html">section 2</a>,
										our aim is to identify and characterise putative subpopulations in the PDGFRα+ve cells.</p>
                                    <p>Clustering was performed using the SC3 package (CITATION), an unsupervised clustering package for R specific for single cell data that works using a modified k-means algorithm.
										K-means clustering works on the basis that observations (cells in this case) belong to one of the k clusters with the nearest mean. </p>
                                    <p>To get an initial estimate on the number of clusters in our data we relied on SC3, which estimates a total number of 9 clusters. 
										However, since our population should be quite homogenous and with SC3 being prone to overestimate the number of clusters, further analysis where performed with a range of k from 2 to 9. 
										On <a href="#consensus_k">Figure 11</a> consensus plots obtained from k=3,4,7,9 are shown.</p>
									
									<div class="box">
                                        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/consensus_difK.png" id="consensus_k" /></span>
                                        <p>Figure 11: .</p>
                                    </div>
									<p>From that range of four different cluster numbers we chose to work with k=4 as an in-between compromise of a high enough silhouette and biological feasibility (this will be discussed further in <a href="discussion.html">section 6</a>).
										The clusters obtained from SC3 can then be mapped on the t-SNE and UMAP spaces to visualize how well defined they appear.
										For comparison sake, on <a href="#spaces_k">Figure 12</a> both k=4 and k=9 are plotted on t-SNE and UMAP spaces.</p>
									<div class="box">
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/spaces_k.png" id="spaces_k" /></span>
										<p>Figure 12: .</p>
									</div>
									<p>Comparing the SC3 consensus plots in <a href="#consensus_k">Figure 11</a> with those using the UMAP+k-means clusters (see <a href="#consensus_umap">Figure 13</a>) 
										shows the same phenomena observed on <a href="#spaces_k">Figure 12</a>, in where the higher k is the more convergent both methodologies will be, represented in <a href="#consensus_umap">Figure 13</a> as more overlapping with the UMAP+kmeans clusters.</p>
									<div class="box">
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/consensus_umap.png" id="consensus_umap" /></span>
										<p>Figure 13: .</p>
									</div>
									<p>Finally, standalone k-means clustering was performed on the reduced dimensions calculated in <a href="#vis">Visualisation</a>.
										When plotted on their DR space the clusters obtained did appear to divide the data more evenly.
										A comparison with k=4 of the SC3 and UMAP+k-means clusters is shown plotted on the UMAP dimensions in <a href="#interact_umap">Figure 14</a>.</p>
