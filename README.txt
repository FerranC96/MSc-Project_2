THIS IS NOT A FINAL VERSION. IF YOU ARE READING THIS THEN IT MEANS I HAVE SOMEHOW SCREWED THE LOCATION OF PUBLIC_HTML, SINCE THIS FILE SHOULD ONLY BE ON MY HOMEDIR (ON IMEPRIALS NETWORK, ACCESED VIA SSH FROM MY PERSONAL COMPUTER). THE RIGHT FILES ARE ON ~/PUBLIC_HTML WHEN ACCESSED FROM IMPERIAL'S DESKTOPS
